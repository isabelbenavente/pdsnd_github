### Date created
14th of May 2020

### Project Title
Python project for Udacity's 'Programming for Data Science with Python' Nanodegree

### Description
I've written a script to create an interactive experience in the terminal
that presents statistics about bikeshare data for 3 U.S. cities.

The user is prompted to choose a city of interest and specify date filters if desired.
It is also possible to view raw data within the terminal.

### Files used
This script uses data from:

- chicago.csv
- washington.csv
- new\_york\_city.csv

### Credits
[Thanks to all mentors who run the Knowledge Hub. I've found the entries on how to display raw data particularly useful.](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")
